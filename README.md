Time series forecasting is employed in various sectors, including finance, supply chain management, production, and inventory planning, making it one of the most widely used data science approaches. Time series forecasting has many applications, including resource allocation, business planning, weather forecasts, and stock price prediction.
Time series forecasting can be used by any business or organization dealing with continuously generated data and the requirement to adjust to operational shifts and changes. Here, machine learning acts as the greatest enabler, improving our ability to:
Web traffic forecasting: In order to forecast online traffic rates during certain periods, common data on typical traffic rates among competing websites is combined with input data on traffic-related trends.
Sales and demand forecasting: Customer behavior pattern data, in combination with inputs from purchase history, demand history, seasonal influence, etc., enables machine learning models to identify the most demanded items and pinpoint their placement in the dynamic market.
Weather prediction: Time-based data is routinely collected from a variety of globally networked weather stations, and machine learning approaches enable in-depth analysis and interpretation of the data for future forecasts based on statistical dynamics.
Stock price forecasting: In order to make accurate forecasts of the most likely impending stock price movements, one can integrate historical stock price data with information on regular and atypical spikes and decreases in the stock market.
Economic and demographic forecasting: Demographics and economics have a ton of statistical data that can be utilized to forecast time series data effectively. Consequently, the ideal target market can be determined, and the most effective strategies to communicate with that specific TA may be developed.
Academics: The concepts of machine learning and deep learning greatly speed up the processes of refining and launching scientific ideas. For instance, scientific data that must go through infinite analytical cycles may be analyzed considerably more quickly with machine learning patterns.
