The Conclusion:-
Seasonal Exponential Smoothing - The best smoothing level value is 1 and the model build on this value has an RMS error value of 28.93.
Holt's Model - The best smoothing level value is 0.18 and smoothing slope value is 0.77. The model build on these parameters have an RMS error value is 11.17.
Holt - Winter- Method - Plotting both seasonal and trend to be multiplicative gives the best results. The model build with these parameters gives an RMS error is 3.716.
From these conclusions we find that the Holt- Winter-Model is preferable.
